    <h1>Happy Guuuurlfriend Day</h1>
    <p>
<br><br>
Hey... there.
<br><br>
I just wanted to tell you how much you mean to me. I seriously can't wait to see you again! You make me so happy. <br> <br> Whether itâ€™s Girlfriend Day, your birthday, or the day you finally get a job (500 million years from now), I want you to keep this on speed dial for when Iâ€™m being annoying, so you can blackmail me with it.

Youâ€™re the prettiest, most special (hmm) girl ever, and I really canâ€™t wait until weâ€™re together again.
<br><br>
And for the record, ChatGPT didnâ€™t even help me write this. All from the ol' noggin (pretty cool, right?).
<br><br>
Never change. I want you to always be confident in yourself. Even my friends say it, you make me a better person and it's annoyingly true.
<br><br>
You're the best new media designer I know (wellâ€¦(jk)) and the labneh to my hash. I love you so much.
(Donâ€™t show this to anyone, Iâ€™m supposed to be sigma).
<br><br>
Love you to Europe and back (You canâ€™t drive there),
<br>â€” Your #1 Fan ðŸ’—
